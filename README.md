# Graphing-Sensor-Data-on-a-PC
This project involves sending data from analog inputs on an Arduino board to a PC, where the data is graphed in real-time using processing software.The project uses two analog inputs, and the values from these inputs are updated on the processing software based on the values received.

## Assumptions
It is assumed that the following hardware and software setup is used for this project:
+ Arduino Uno board
+ Two analog inputs connected to the Arduino board
+ Processing software installed on the PC
